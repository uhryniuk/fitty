# fitty
health n' fitness tracking

## Thoughts

Webapp has 2 main features
1. The daily tracker
  - Put ur weight
  - foods
  - exercises
  - other data
  - ideally, none of this is hardcoded.
  - perhaps we can make dynamic way to declare it all

2. Dataset builder
  - Export your info for ur own stats.
  - Have high level stats in app

3. Friends / Viewer
  - Check others workouts
  - See what they ate
  - See how much they weigh
  - See how they declared their datasets
    - Copy and use others perhaps too?
    - If this, you can compare them.

## Requirements
- Web app for sure
- Could we use react native to make it work on mobile too?
- Nice SSO, start small batch with me and nick.
- Frontend -> React Native? Some rust or Go binding?
- Backend -> Perferably Python, Rust, Go, Kotlin
