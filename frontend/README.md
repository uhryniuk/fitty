# Research


## Frontend


## Backend
- Need to learn more about multiprocessing in python.
- apparently splitting threads blocks the GIL
- 


## Standards
- Writing unit tests for both the frontend and the backend
  - Going to try to keep as little functionality as possible in the frontend.


## Planning
- Start with some early prototyping of the UI
- Early DB prototyping
  - NoSQL vs SQL
  - May be easier to make SQL honestly since it's so consistent to use.
  - also have lots of eperience usig the libs in python.



## Development
- Using the native build system in svelte with vite for development, makes it mad easy.
  - Not sure if i can do more coniguration with it?
  - Also got to practice using Typescipt a lot more.


## Deployment
- How the hell do i build the svelte frontend with the compiler? apparently it's `npm run build`

- No idea how we really deploy FastAPI
  - The docs make it seem like it's as easy as just running the normal command on the deployment server.
  - Got to be careful with this.

# Project Plan

## Initial Work Request
- Webapp that we can create a profile and track our health data
- Create dynamic data sets with the tracked data
- Then being able to perform analysis on the that data
- Charting, exporting, everything in between.
- Track workouts as well.

## Requirements Gathering
- We need it to be simple
  - Can we do some sort of perma-login per device?
  - They do this with google apps.

## System Study Review

## Design Review

## Implementation.
